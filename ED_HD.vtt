00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Default >At the left we can see...

2
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Default >At the right we can see the...

3
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Default >...the head-snarlers

4
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Default >Everything is safe.
Perfectly safe.

5
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Default >Emo?

6
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Default >Watch out!

7
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Default >Are you hurt?

8
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Default >I don't think so.
You?

9
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Default >I'm Ok.

10
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Default >Get up.
Emo, it's not safe here.

11
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.570
<v Default >Let's go.

12
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Default >What's next?

13
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Default >You'll see!

14
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Default >Emo.
This way.

15
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Default >Follow me!

16
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Default >Hurry Emo!

17
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.930
<v Default >You're not paying attention!

18
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.050
<v Default >I just want to answer the...
...phone.

19
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.970
<v Default >Emo, look,
I mean listen.

20
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Default >You have to learn to listen.

21
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Default >This is not some game.

22
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Default >You, I mean we,
we could easily die out here.

23
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.950
<v Default >Listen,
listen to the sounds of the machine.

24
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.000
<v Default >Listen to your breathing.

25
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Default >Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

26
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Default >Tired?!?

27
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Default >Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

28
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.070
<v Default >One move out of place...

29
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Default >...and you're ground to a pulp.

30
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Default >But isn't it -

31
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Default >Pulp, Emo!
Is that what you want, pulp?

32
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.990
<v Default >Emo, your goal in life...

33
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.950
<v Default >...pulp?

34
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Default >Emo, close your eyes.

35
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.020
<v Default >Why?
- Now!

36
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Default >Ok.

37
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Default >Good.

38
00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.100
<v Default >What do you see at your left side, Emo?

39
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.890
<v Default >Nothing.
- Really?

40
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Default >No, nothing at all.

41
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Default >And at your right,
what do you see at your right side, Emo?

42
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Default >The same Proog, exactly the same...

43
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Default >...nothing!
- Great.

44
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Default >Listen Proog! Do you hear that!

45
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Default >Can we go here?

46
00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.890
<v Default >There?
It isn't safe, Emo.

47
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Default >But...
- Trust me, it's not.

48
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Default >Maybe I could...

49
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Default >No.

50
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Default >NO!

51
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Default >Any further questions, Emo?

52
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Default >No.

53
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Default >Emo?

54
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Default >Emo, why...

55
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.020
<v Default >Emo...

56
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.000
<v Default >...why can't you see
the beauty of this place?

57
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.040
<v Default >The way it works.

58
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.890
<v Default >How perfect it is.

59
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Default >No, Proog, I don't see.

60
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Default >I don't see because there's nothing there.

61
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Default >And why should I trust my
life to something that isn't there?

62
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Default >Well can you tell me that?

63
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.920
<v Default >Answer me!

64
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Default >Proog...

65
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.980
<v Default >...you're a sick man!

66
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Default >Stay away from me!

67
00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.880
<v Default >No! Emo! It's a trap!

68
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Default >Hah, it's a trap.

69
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Default >At the left side you can see
the hanging gardens of Babylon!

70
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Default >How's that for a trap?

71
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Default >No, Emo.

72
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Default >At the right side you can see...
...well guess what...

73
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Default >...the colossus of Rhodes!

74
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.050
<v Default >No!

75
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Default >The colossus of Rhodes
and it is here just for you Proog.

76
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Default >It is there...

77
00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Default >I'm telling you,
Emo...

78
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.860
<v Default >...it is.
